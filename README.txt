# wordUnscrambler
literally just a word unscrambler

mostWords.txt came from:
https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
on the page it is called https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt
assume the words in the mostWords.txt list of words merit a person aged appropriately 16+

I don't care what you do with the code, I only want a follower
I would appreciate if you follow me, then you can see what other cool stuff I will code in the future
If you have any suggestions or want to contact me, let me know at ethienduckett@outlook.com
I can add special characters to the unscrambler if you email me
thank you
also I am not to be held accountable for any of the words in the mostWords.txt file, I did not create it and I don't want any problems
