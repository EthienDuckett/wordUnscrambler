step 0:
call the python file from your terminal
python3 unscrambler.py


If you don't know how to use the program this explains how
step 1:
type out the name of the file that contains words (mostWords.txt has most words in it. So if you are unscrambling ordinary words just use it.)
then press enter to input the file name

mostWords.txt
(press enter)
note that the file name is case-sensitive

Next you must wait because it can take 10-15 seconds for mostWords.txt to be compiled into a dictonary. The dictonary takes the number of each letter and assigns it to the word(s) that can be formed using the letters


The terminal will now output a string that tells you to enter words seperately and to press enter to advace, (by words it means to enter the string to be unscrambled) that means:
enter word 1:
olleh
(press enter)
enter word 2:
dlrow
(press enter)
enter word 3:
htnuehtn

you may repeat this process until you have entered all of the words
then press enter with the field blank to advace to the next step
enter word 4:
(press enter)


the next step gives you the option to correct any typos. It is obvious that 3 is not a word so I will demonstrate me fixing it.
the format is like this
3yppah
(press enter)

this step can also be repeated and ended in the same way as the previous step
(word # that was typoed followed by the correct version)

the final step is the output, the unscrambled words will be listed in the order they were entered in in a document called unscrambled.txt

the terminal will say some stuff, but that is just because I am lazy and didn't want to comment it out or anything so ignore it
